Apache-logs
===========

Generate useful statistics with Apache access.log using NodeJS

##To-Do List
  * Build a clean orgnized interface (Possibly similar to `Top command` interface)
  * Find an alternative for auto-update on change function other than NodeJS built-in function `require("fs").watchFile()`
  * Create statistics features ( In Issues sections )

## How can I help?
  You can help by forking or by requesting features in the `Issues section`.
